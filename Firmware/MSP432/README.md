# Firmware
Firmware for both the MSP432 and ESP32 is found here:

The MSP432 is the microcontroller unit used for this project. It is used to communicate to the sensors/analog to digital converters,
as well as an electronic paper display.

The ESP32 Wifi Module is used to connect the microcontroller unit as well as the cloud databse to facilitate the transfer of data between them. From there this data
can be published to the web application.
